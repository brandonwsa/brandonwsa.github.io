        <h1>My Projects:</h1>
        <p>Here are some of my projects I have worked on, or adding onto.
        They are all repositories on github. Simply click the link for the project
        you would like to view below.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>Virtual Monopoly Deal</h2>
        <p>Written in Java using Netbeans IDE. This project is a two semester long project for my Software Engineering classes
        where I am working alongside a partner. This game is a virtualized version of the popular card game, 
        Monopoly Deal, where players build properties, collect money, and play actions against one another before someone wins 
        by getting three complete property sets. I am going to continue to work on this project post
        graduation to implement peer to peer playability so me and my friends who enjoyed playing the card version of this game 
        can once again play with one another.</p>

        <h2>Workout Buddy</h2>
        <p>Written in Python and HTML with Django, SQLite, and bootstrap following RESTful API and a microservice approach using Visual Studio Code. This is a web application that 
        is practicing my skills in microservices and RESTful api by utilizing the popular web framework Django. In this web app the main features allow the user to: create an account and 
        utilize CRUD functionalities on workouts and exercises apps in the project.</p>
        <p>You can create new workouts, add exercises to those workouts, and for each exercise you can define if you did the same weight for each set, if not, 
        you are able to add the specified weight, sets, and reps to the exercise details. Once this information is also gathered, the volume of exercise is also calculated 
        based on the amount of reps, sets, and weight you used for that exercise. The user has access to a profile page where they can view each individual workout and their 
        exercises in those workouts they have done throughout time.</p>
        <p>The project will eventually be converted into an application that uses both React and Django. Also, during this phase, the conversion to a better microservice architecture will 
        take place that will implement seperate databases accordingly to each service to keep coupling low</p>

        <h2>Alien Invasion</h2>
        <p>Written in Python using Visual Studio Code and Pygame module. This is a side project developed
        to help me learn Python and to strengthen my high cohesion and low coupling practices. This is 
        2D arcade style shooter where you defend your ship from alien swarms.</p>

        <h2>Radio Station Website</h2>
        <p>Utilizes Turnkey LAMP, PHP, Javascript, Apache, 
        Angular JS, HTML 5, and MySQL to make the website. Working on this semester with a partner. 
        The website will allow the user to tune into the 
        songs that are contained in the server.</p>

        <h2>Calculator App</h2>
        <p>Written in Java using Android Studio. This side project was designed to introduce me to 
        App Development for Android. This is a simple distance to speed to time calculator. 
        A good use of this calculator would be to find out how fast you would have to drive in order 
        to cover the distance (in miles) provided from user and the time (in hours) in which you want 
        cover that distance. The app will be put on the Play Store.</p>

        <h2>Process Scheduler</h2>
        <p>Written in C using Vim editor in UNIX. This assignment was given to me in my Operating Systems
        class and was designed to teach us how process scheduling algorithms work. We created our own Round Robin 
        and First Come First Serve algorithms for scheduling and also made our own Doubly Linked Lists. 
        The program takes in a text file of a list of processes burst times and performs the desired scheduled algorithm 
        to schedule the processes.</p>

        <h2>Myshell</h2>
        <p>Written in C using Vim editor in UNIX. This assignment was given to me in my operating Systems 
        class and was designed to teach us how a shell works and to give us practice with creating new processes 
        and executing given files and commands.</p>
