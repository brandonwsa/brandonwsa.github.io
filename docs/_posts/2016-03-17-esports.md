## My Journey
The first time I was able to use my hands, a game controller was placed in them and I began playing without any realization of how impactful this hobby would be in my life. Gaming has always been something special to me. The amount of people I have met from it still amazes me. I had no idea that playing a game would connect me to so many people from Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, South America, and more! Meeting all these people, whether they were teammates or friends made through the game, is such a great experience as all of these people are from different parts of the world, but yet we are to be connected under a shared interest.

When growing up and going through the K-12 education system, I knew that working with technology was my goal in life. So I started investing into expanding my knowledge with computers and decided to start gaming on them as well. Gaming on computers ended up teaching me a lot about how computers operate and soon I began writing and editing simple mods for some games. Every time an error happened with the computer or with the game, I would get really excited as I was able to explore why this error was occuring and fix it myself. Soon my friends realized this and began coming to me for any issues they had with their computers as well.

Growing up, I played soccer for about ten years and got involved in track as a distance runner. Come high school I got more involved in drumline and jazz band, so I put soccer and track to rest, which allowed me to also begin working part time jobs as well. During my senior year of high school I began to get invested in competitive gaming more and more. It started with me getting hooked with getting better at the Elder Scrolls Online PvP content. I loved the mechanics of this game and soon I began creating helpful videos for players and gained a bit of popularity from the game as well. When one of my friends I played this game with introduced me to PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG), I instantly got hooked and little did I know how much this game would have an impact on my life, I give a lot of credit to those friends who introduced me to PUBG.

During my early years of college, I worked part time jobs and also started to get invested in the competitive scene in PUBG. After grinding the competitive scene for a good bit, my hard work was starting pay off. I was entering more and more tournaments and leagues, worked with organizations, left organizations, played in some more tournaments and leagues, and soon I qualified for my first LAN tournament in Seattle, Washington when I transferred to Western Illinois University in the fall of 2018.

This was a unique tournament as it was duo gameplay focused, which typically most tournaments and leagues were four man squad team focused. My partner and I ended up in 3rd place and with 2nd most kills in the game, just 1 kill off from first, so not bad for our first LAN tournament. After we got back from Seattle, I had to grind out some of the work I missed from school and my teammate decided it was time for him to step down from competing. I began searching for new teammates to grow with and to enter a new major league that was coming up which was created by the South Korean cable company OGN.

I eventually found more teammates. Leading up to the qualifiers for this league, we began growing our team synergy by entering any and every tournament and leagues possible to quickly get adjusted to each other's play style, and with the help of coaches, vod reviews, and a lot of hard work, we knew we would be able to qualify for this league.

As the fall 2018 semester came to an end and finals week began at my college, the qualifiers began. Not only did I have to study up for my finals in college, I also had to qualify for a very important league that would set our team apart from many others and put us in Los Angeles. So I began preparing for both. I ended up having to stay later than everyone else at my college dorms just so I could get to play in the last two days of the qualifiers, and it paid off. We qualified to fly out to Los Angeles and would begin competing in this new major league in January! I also ended up only getting one B in my classes too after finals, so I was very proud and excited.

The arena was amazing, and considering how fast OGN built the arena was very impressive as well. After coming back from out first trip to compete, I had more school work I had to catch up on. This became a common pattern though, as we would end up traveling back out to Los Angeles four more times that semester to compete, I soon adjusted pretty well to this pattern and was able to juggle both being a full time student and competing full time just fine. It was very important that I seperated the two and gave appropriate time to focus on both. This allowed me to keep my grades high and to continue to grow as a player.

When we were not competing in Los Angeles, we competed in an online format for the league, so continuous practice and scrimming was needed to stay in top shape. My whole spring 2019 semester involved me traveling, practicing, and studying Computer Science. We would usually travel on a Wednesday and would return on a Monday, so I was lucky that the travel time included the weekend.

Once summer hit, I was again proud and excited that I kept my grades up high and was able to consistently compete. Now that I had full focus on competing, we were preparing for our next trip out to Los Angeles, and for a couple of us on the team, it was our last one. This last trip was to mark the end of the second season for the league, and there would be a small break before the third season began. After completing the season strong, and coming back from our last trip out in Los Angeles, for the season, me and two others decided it was time to step down from the competitive scene and focus on other priorities in life. One teammate had a baby on the way, was getting a new house, and needed to focus on those things. I decided that it was time for me to begin focusing more on the long term career path I wanted to pursue when I was out of college. With a year and a half left, I wanted to give myself plenty of time to dive more into Computer Science while at college and to also grow my interest in fitness and Exercise Science. After splitting up, we all still keep in touch and our coach was able to work with other teams in the PC and Mobile leagues to help them grow as well. I'm really grateful I got to experience such an amazing journey, as it helped me grow in many different ways.

Now that I graduated from college in Fall of 2020, I have been continuously developing projects, researching, and actively looking for positions as a Software Engineer, where I look forward to assisting in projects, big or small, that will impact our society in a positive way.
