        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>Graduate from WIU looking for full-time opportunities. I have always have been extremely passionate about technology, 
        leading me to pursue Computer Science as a career where I'm eager to work with Software Engineering, Web Applications, Artificial Intelligence, 
        or Game Development. I first started programming in Java in 2014 and instantly knew I wanted to help expand this amazing industry. When I hit 
        college I pursued one of my dream careers and became a Professional EAthlete in the Esport Industry in the popular battle royal game PUBG 
        where I got to travel and compete professionally in the United States, while also continuing to grow my skills in Computer Science at WIU. 
        Utilizing my skills I grew in the Esports Industry, from obtaining my Computer Science degree, and personal projects, I am eager to continue to 
        grow my skills in the Computer Science industry and to make a positive impact in the industry.</p>
