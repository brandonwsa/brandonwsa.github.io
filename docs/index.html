        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>Graduate from WIU looking for full-time opportunities. I have always been extremely passionate about technology, 
        leading me to pursue Computer Science as a career where I'm eager to work with Software Engineering, Web Applications, Artificial Intelligence, 
        or Game Development. I first started programming in Java in 2014 and instantly knew I wanted to help expand this amazing industry. When I hit college 
        I pursued one of my dream careers and became a Professional EAthlete in the Esports and Entertainment Industry in the popular battle royal game PUBG 
        where I got to travel and compete alongside some amazing individuals in the United States, while also continuing to grow my skills in Computer Science at WIU. 
        Once I achieved the goals I set out for, I stepped down from competing to finish off my last year and a half with full focus on my degree, future career path as a developer, and fitness. I'm grateful 
        I got to experience this career as it grew a lot of my soft skills that I can bring to a team environment. When I'm not at the computer growing my skills in Web Application and 
        Software Development, you can find me at the gym or out with friends.</p>
