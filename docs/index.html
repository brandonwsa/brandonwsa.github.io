        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>I have always have been extremely passionate about technology, leading me to pursue Computer Science as a 
        career where I plan to work with Software Engineering, Web Applications, Game Development, and Artificial Intelligence. I am a 
        former Professional EAthlete in the Esport Industry for PUBG where I got to travel and compete in the United States while 
        also attending college. After stepping down from competing professionaly I still enjoy to game, but I enjoy learning how 
        games are made more now. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge I have developed from competing and college to grow in 
        the Computer Science industry and one day create my own competitive game for professional EAthletes to compete in.</p>
