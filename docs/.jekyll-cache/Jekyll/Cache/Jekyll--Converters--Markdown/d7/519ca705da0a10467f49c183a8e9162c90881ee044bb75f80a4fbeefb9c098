I"<p>Iâ€™m not your typical Software Engineer. While studying Computer Science at Western illinois University, class of Fall 2020, I also decided to take on a career of playing a video game professionally and became an EAthlete in the Esports and Entertainment industry. I competed in the popular battle royal game PUBG, where I got to travel and compete alongside many amazing individuals in the United States. Time management during my studies and competing was a simple adjustment of priorities. When I was not growing my skills in Software Engineering, I would grow my skills as an EAthlete, when I did get free time, it was usually spent with those closest to me. After achieving the goals I set out for, I stepped down from competing to finish off my last year and a half with full focus on my degree, career path as a Software Engineer, and fitness. When taking on a career as an EAthlete, I knew it would transfer over to my career as a Software Engineer fairly well, as the soft skills I grew while being in this professional environment have helped me become a better critical thinker and overall a better team player. Since I have been out of college, I have continued my research and development of projects to further grow my skills in Web Application and Software Development. Ever since I got introduced to Java in 2014, I instantly fell in love with programming and knew it would be long term career of choice. I look forward to the day where I can assist in projects, large or small, that impact the world we live in in a positive way.</p>
