I"®<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>
<p>The first time I was able to use my hands, a game controller was placed in them and I began playing without any realization of how impactful this hobby would be in my life. Gaming has always been something special to me. The amount of people I have met from it still amazes me. I had no idea that playing a game would connect me to so many people from Africa, Australia, Europe, Asia, South America, and more! Meeting all these people, whether they were teammates or friends made through the game, is such a great experience as all of these people are from different parts of the world, but yet we are to be connected under a shared interest.</p>
