<h2 id="workout-buddy">Workout Buddy</h2>
<p>Written in Python, Django, HTML 5, CSS, SQLite, and bootstrap in a Docker container, allowing RESTful API and architectured in a modular design approach using Visual Studio Code. This is a web application that is practicing converting a modular design to microservices, where the situation sees fit, and allowing RESTful api by utilizing the popular web framework Django. In this web app the main features allow the user to: create an account and utilize CRUD functionalities on workouts and exercises apps in the project. The web application also allows mobile users to have a good UI experience as well.</p>

<p>You can create new workouts, add exercises to those workouts, and for each exercise you can define if you did the same weight for each set, if not, you are able to add the specified weight, sets, and reps to the exercise details. Once this information is also gathered, the volume of exercise is also calculated based on the amount of reps, sets, and weight you used for that exercise. The user has access to a profile page where they can view each individual workout and their exercises in those workouts they have done throughout time.</p>

<p>A Demo video of the application can be seen here:</p>

<h2 id="covid-active-cases">COVID Active Cases</h2>
<p>Deployed at: <a href="https://brandonwsa.github.io/covid-active-cases-frontend/">COVID Active Cases</a> or see button in header.</p>

<p>Written in TypeScript, HTML 5, and CSS utilizing React and Chart-js-2, this Web Application monitors the current active COVID-19 cases in the United States and individual states, that the user selects, in both table and graph form, along with a total of positive active live cases and calculated percentage of the population that currently has the virus based on the API. The frontend calls API calls to get reliable data from CDC’s API, previously ‘The COVID Tracking Project’ API, until it ended. I Chose to do this project to help improve my skills with frontend technologies like React and learn a new programming language, TypeScript, which is a super set of JavaScript, transcompiling to JavaScript. I used both Hooks and Components for this project.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-monopoly-deal">Virtual Monopoly Deal</h2>
<p>Written in Java using Netbeans IDE using Object-Oriented Programming, Design, and Analysis. This project was a two semester long project for my Software Engineering classes where I worked alongside a partner creating the program, testing the program, writting an SRS Document, Project Managment Plan, designing a gantt chart, data model diagram, sequence diagram, class diagram, activity diagram, use case diagram, and other activities. This game is a virtualized version of the popular card game, Monopoly Deal, where players build properties, collect money, and play actions against one another before someone wins by getting three complete property sets. I am going to continue to work on this project post graduation to implement peer to peer playability so me and my friends who enjoyed playing the card version of this game can once again play with one another.</p>

<h2 id="radio-station-website">Radio Station Website</h2>
<p>Utilizes Turnkey LAMP, PHP, Javascript, Apache, Angular JS, HTML 5, and MySQL to make the web application. I developed this application along side a partner for my Server Side Web class alongside a partner where I built the full backend, connected backend to frontend, and built audio player in JavaScript to play the songs. The web application allows the user to play .mp3 files off of the server by getting the file url from MySQL and using an audio player made in Javascript to play the audio on the front end for the user. Once the last song is played, all of the songs will replay in order again.</p>

<p>This project introduced me to developing a web application from a full stack position by learning how to create a backend and frontend and to get the data from the backend to the frontend inorder for the media to be played. I also learned how to create a simple media player in javascript to consume the data that was brought in from the backend to play the audio, display the song name, and artist to the user. I also grew familiar working with MariaDB while working on this project as well.</p>

<h2 id="alien-invasion">Alien Invasion</h2>
<p>Written in Python using Visual Studio Code and Pygame module. This is a side project developed to help me learn Python and to strengthen my high cohesion and low coupling practices and uses object-oriented programming. This is 2D arcade style shooter where you defend your ship from alien swarms.</p>

<h2 id="distance-calculator-app">Distance Calculator App</h2>
<p>Written in Java using Android Studio. This side project was designed to introduce me to App Development for Android. This is a simple distance to speed to time calculator. A good use of this calculator would be to find out how fast you would have to drive in order to cover the distance (in miles) provided from user and the time (in hours) in which you want cover that distance.</p>

<h2 id="process-scheduler">Process Scheduler</h2>
<p>Written in C using Vim editor in UNIX. This assignment was given to me in my Operating Systems class and was designed to teach us how process scheduling algorithms work. We created our own Round Robin and First Come First Serve algorithms for scheduling and also made our own Doubly Linked Lists. The program takes in a text file of a list of processes burst times and performs the desired scheduled algorithm to schedule the processes.</p>

<h2 id="myshell">MyShell</h2>
<p>Written in C using Vim editor in UNIX. This assignment was given to me in my operating Systems class and was designed to teach us how a shell works and to give us practice with creating new processes and executing given files and commands.</p>
